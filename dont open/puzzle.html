    <p class="friend">“There are many causes for a suicide, and generally the most obvious ones were not the most powerful. Rarely is suicide committed (yet the hypothesis is not excluded) through reflection.
        What sets off the crisis is almost always unverifiable. Newspapers often speak of “personal sorrows” or of “incurable illness.” These explanations are plausible. But one would have to know whether a "........" of the desperate man had not that very day addressed him indifferently. He is the guilty one. For that is enough to precipitate all the rancors and all the boredom still in suspension.”

     <p class="friend">"Now was the day departing¹, and the air, Im brown'd with shadows, from their toils released All animals on earth; and I alone Prepared myself the conflict to sustain, Both of sad pity, and that perilous road, Which my unerring memory shall retrace.

        O Muses! "....." high genius! now vouchsafe Your aid. O mind! that all I saw hast kept Safe in a written record, here thy worth And eminent endowments come to proof.

    <p class="friend">“Once while Galatea let Scylla comb her hair, she addressed these words to her, sighing often: ‘At least, O virgin Scylla, you are not wooed by a relentless breed of men: and you can reject them without fear, as you do. But I, whose father is Nereus, and whose mother is sea-green Doris, I, though protected by a crowd of sisters, was not allowed to flee the love of Polyphemus, the Cyclops, except through sorrow’, and tears stopped the sound of her voice. When the girl had wiped away the tears with her white fingers, and the goddess was comforted, she said: ‘Tell me, O ".........." one: do not hide the cause of your sadness (I can be so trusted)’ The Nereid answered Crateis’s daughter in these words: Acis was the son of Faunus and the nymph Symaethis....”</p>

    <p class="friend">"A little while I sighed to find him gone, A little while the dawning was alone, And the light gathered; then I held my breath, And shuddered at the sight of Eld and Death. 
        Alas! Love passed me in the twilight dun, His music hushed the wakening ousel’s song; 
        But on these twain shone out the golden sun, And o’er their heads the brown bird’s tune was strong, As shivering, twixt the trees they stole along; 
        None noted aught their noiseless passing by, The world had quite forgotten it must die. 
        NOW must these men be glad a little while That they had lived to see May once more "........" </p>
